#PinWindow

A small utility to make a window to be (or not to be) on top of other windows.

Resides in the system tray.

No installation required for executables. Just download [PinWindow-x86.exe](https://github.com/andriy-denysenko/PinWindow/raw/master/PinWindow-x86.exe) or [PinWindow-x64.exe](https://github.com/andriy-denysenko/PinWindow/raw/master/PinWindow-x64.exe) and start it.

To use the script (an ahk file) instead of exe, please download and install AutoHotkey 1.1 from https://www.autohotkey.com/download/1.1/ (scroll down and download the latest version).

Usage:

Hold Win button and click anywhere in the window you want to pin on top of other windows.

Use the same action (Win+left button click) to unpin a pinned window.
